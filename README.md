## Projects
- [Analysis of Unicorn Startups - SQL](https://github.com/Izaan-m/SQL-Projects/blob/main/Mini%20Assignment.sql) - In this project, I built a database named unicorn_companies to analyze unicorn startups. I created a unicorns table to store data on company names, countries, sectors, valuations, founding years, and investors, populating it with notable examples like SpaceX and Stripe. Using SQL queries, I extracted insights on trends such as the leading countries for unicorns, average valuations by sector, and investor distributions. The analysis highlighted growth patterns and provided a detailed look at the FinTech sector's total valuation, offering a comprehensive view of the unicorn landscape.

  
- [Store Sale Analysis: Insights and Trends - Excel](https://github.com/Izaan-m/Excel_Project/blob/main/Store%20Sale%20Analysis.xlsx) - In the "Store Sale Analysis" Excel project, I conducted a detailed analysis of sales data to uncover trends and insights regarding store performance. The dataset includes variables such as product categories, sales figures, dates, and customer demographics. I utilized various Excel tools, including pivot tables and charts, to summarize sales performance across different categories and time periods. Key analyses included identifying top-selling products, evaluating sales trends over time, and analyzing customer purchasing patterns. The findings provide valuable insights for inventory management, marketing strategies, and overall business performance.

- [Hospital Analysis: Patient Care and Financial Insights - PowerBI](https://github.com/Izaan-m/PowerBI/blob/main/Health%20-%20Project.pdf) - In the "Health Project" Power BI analysis, I examined comprehensive data from a hospital, focusing on various aspects of patient care and operational efficiency. The dataset included critical information such as patient admission and discharge dates, follow-up dates, diagnoses, doctors' details, and billing amounts. Utilizing Power BI's visualization tools, I created interactive dashboards to analyze patient demographics, track disease prevalence, and monitor treatment outcomes over time. Key insights included identifying trends in patient admissions, evaluating the efficiency of follow-up care, and assessing the financial performance associated with different treatments. This analysis aims to enhance decision-making for hospital management, improve patient care processes, and optimize billing practices.
